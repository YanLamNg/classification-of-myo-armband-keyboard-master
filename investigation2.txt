Investigation 2

We were using cross validation with the 90% training and 10% test data to calculate the average accuracy.
result:
    average accuracy:
        multi-axis composition:
            All Data:               0.96
            All accelerometer       0.60
            All emg:                0.92
            All gyroscope:          0.64
            All orientation:        0.54
            All orientationRule:    0.74

        single dimension:
            emg1: 0.56
            emg2: 0.22
            emg3: 0.44
            emg4: 0.54
            emg5: 0.64
            emg6: 0.44
            emg7: 0.56
            emg8: 0.76

The result show that the multi-axis composition is better than the single dimension.
The best result from the single dimension is emg8 which is 0.76 average accuracy.
The best result from the multi-axis composition is all data which is the 0.96 average accuracy.
But the All emg data is 0.92 average accuracy. We can see that the emg data is the main factor to determine the keyboard command.
